  “I felt like I was being passed from pillar to post and not being listened to,
  given different medications and just told to ‘get on with it’,” Martha says.<br>
  The 22-year-old says she had been experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety
  since the age of 14, but it wasn’t until university that she was given the help
  she needed.<br>
  <br>Originally from South Wales, Martha says that before coming to the West Midlands,
  services and help felt virtually non-existent and the only help that she knew of
  for her age was Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and a school
  councillor:<br>
<br><div class=quote>“It felt like the lack of services and quality was making me so much worse,
  it felt like I just spiralled out of control.”</div><br>
  <br>She wasn’t the only one.<br>
  <br>A previous user of CAMHS, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that they too
  weren’t sure of what services were available as a teenager either:<br>
  <br><i>“I was hoping to gain access to support, probably counselling
    services, by booking an appointment with my GP because I thought that’s what
    would be most helpful, as I was adamant I’d never take medication due to the
    stigma around it a few years ago.”</i><br>
    <br>At the age of 13, they attended a service based in Walsall and was appointed
    an adolescent mental health practitioner, access to CAMHS and offered medication
    alongside these services:<br>
  <br><i>“The mental health practitioner visited me weekly in
    school and taught me techniques to cope with my depression and anxiety.
    I was attended weekly counselling appointments by CAHMS, which was amazing,
    and I couldn’t have asked for someone better to help me through such a
    difficult time in my life.”</i><br>
    <br>They refer to how their friends experienced a different situation, saying
    that they faced weeks of waiting times, switched between councillors and couldn’t
    find the “needed stability” they required for treatments.<br>
    <br>Figures <a href"https://www.mind.org.uk/news-campaigns/news/mind-reveals-thousands-of-mental-health-appointments-for-children-cancelled-by-the-nhs-in-england/">
      attained</a> by the mental health charity Mind found that the demand for
      mental health services for children and young people had increased 17% in
      July 2019 from the previous year.<br>
    <br>The demand for the service CAMHS was at its highest in July 2019 since
    August 2017 with 453,112 total appointments.<br>

    <br>While the demand for the services rise, appointments cancelled by the NHS
    in England for CAMHS increased by 35% in July 2019 from the previous year.<br>

    <br>After starting university and engaging in mental health services in the
    West Midlands, Martha started to feel like she was being “passed pillar to post.<br>
    <br><div class="quote">“It took three years of going back and forth, along with me
      reaching extremely low points, self-harming and serious thoughts of suicide before
      I got the help I needed”.</div>
    <br>The latest <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey/adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey-survey-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing-england-2014">
      <b>data</b></a> from 2014 by the Office for National Statistics show that self-harm
    is most common among younger people in the age category 16–24 compared to other age
    groups.<br>
    <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/1276303"></div>

    <br>Samaritans <a href="https://media.samaritans.org/documents/SamaritansSuicideStatsReport_2019_Dec19_compressed.pdf"><b>say:</b></a><br>
    <br><i>“Self-harm is a sign of serious emotional distress and, while most people who
    self-harm will not go on to take their own life, it is a strong risk factor for
    future suicide.</i>
    <br>From experience, Martha says:<br>
    <br><i>“There should be more services that deal with ‘less serious’ cases as these
    can turn very serious.</i><br>
    <br><div class="quote">“I shouldn’t have had someone on the crisis team tell me I needed to be
      trying to end my life there and then to get help. I couldn’t get out of bed,
      it felt like my brain was holding me hostage. I felt very isolated and felt
      like I wasn’t cared for.”</div><br>
