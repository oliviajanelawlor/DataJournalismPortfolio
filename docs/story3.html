    <br><b>25 new pubs and bars opened in Birmingham in 2019 according to new data
      published by the government.</b><br>
    <br><b>William Stenson</b>, assistant manager at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thecolmore/">
      The Colmore</a> in Birmingham, said:<br>
      <br><i>“Birmingham, in general, is one of the up and coming cities within
        the bar trade and beer scene. 2019 was a great year for opening venues and
        it seems to have exploded the Birmingham beer scene.”</i><br>
      <br>The West Midlands saw the addition of 750 new pubs and bars being opened in 2019.<br>

    <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><br>
    <br>The Colmore opened December 2019 on Colmore Row in Birmingham and reached
    capacity on their opening night.<br>
     <br>Originally set to open early 2019, legal issues delayed the opening
     until the end of the year:<br>
     <br><i>“The building before The Colmore and Lloyds Bank was a Quaker meeting
       house that had a ban on selling alcohol that was still valid, so we needed
       to get that changed legally before we could do anything.”</i>
      <br> The bar is in collaboration with Pivovar, a specialist beer importer,
      and Thornbridge Brewery, both located north of England.<br>
      <br>Mr Stenson said: <i>“Thornbridge beers have become quite common now.
        You see them in supermarkets but you don’t really see their beer in
        Birmingham in casks, kegs or bottles in venues. They have a good reputation
        in the North but that’s it at the minute.”</i><br>
      <br>In the UK, Wiltshire had the highest number of new pubs and bars with
      45 openings.<br>
      <br>Manchester suffered a loss of 50 fewer establishments from 2018 to 2019.<br>
      <br>

      <br>Despite 25 new pubs and bars adding to competition in Birmingham,
      there is a good relationship between local pubs, bars and businesses
      says William Stenson:<br>
      <br><div class="quote">“We’ve had an amazing reception from everyone around here,
        we didn't want to tread on people’s toes. Other bars are supporting us,
        and we are supporting local businesses. We're building a good relationship.”</div><br>
      <br>The opening of 25 new pubs and bars in Birmingham has brought 500 jobs into the city.<br>
      <br>The Colmore said they have a lot of staff to allow flexible hours for their
      staff as well as employing local university students.<br>
      <br>The UK has seen an increase in employees in pubs and bars from 2018-2019 including
      occupations such as bar staff and chefs/cooks.<br>
      <br><div class="flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/1260146"></div><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><br>
      <br>However, the number of people in the UK eating in restaurants, pubs,
      bars and cafés has decreased by 0.2% from 2018-19.<br>
      <br>Mr Stenson said: <i>“Some days there is an awful lot of food orders and then
        some days we won't get much at all. I think it’s mainly that people come in
        for drinks and then they notice that we have a food menu.”</i><br>
      <br>After being open for a month, he said: <i>“This year is our building
        year so we can try and get out there, get known and next year we can
        really shine.</i><br>
      <br><div class="quote">“We’re improving our menu and improving
        staff training on wines to ensure people know that there is
        something in here for everyone.”</div>
