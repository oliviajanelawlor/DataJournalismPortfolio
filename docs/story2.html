  Birmingham City Council have agreed to give their support of a new Suicide
  Prevention Scheme Strategy for the city.<br>
  <br>The strategy has been co-produced with the council and a wide range of
  organisations as a shared approach to reducing deaths through suicide.<br>
  <br>Provisional <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathscausedbysuicidebyquarterinengland">
  data<a> published by the Office of National Statistics show that in the first
  three quarters of 2019, 400 people died by suicide, an 8% increase
  from the first three quarters of 2018.<br>
  <br>Men suffered the largest increase with 31 more men dying by suicide in the
  first three quarters of 2019 to 2018.<br>

  <br>At the council meeting, Councillor Simon Morrall said: “There is a crisis
  of masculinity in this country, but nobody wants to talk about it.<br>
  <br><div class="quote">“The majority of suicides are men. Men make up a lot of
    domestic violence, rape and sexual violence statistics. We need to start treating
    people as people and put identity in the bin.”</div><br>
  <br>The Suicide Prevention Strategy sets out a series of key priority areas for
  action across the partnership:<br>

  <li>Reducing the risk of suicide in high-risk groups</li>
  <li>Improving mental health in specific groups</li>
  <li>Reducing access to means of suicide</li>
  <li>Provide better information and support to those bereaved or affected by suicide</li>
  <li>Support the media in delivering sensitive approaches to suicide and suicidal behaviour</li>
  <li>Support research, data collection and monitoring</li><br>

  <br>Councillor Alex Aitken strongly supported the strategy and thanked the
  councillors that have broken barriers for talking about suicides and mental health.<br>
  <br>He also supported the priority within the strategy to support the media in reporting
  on suicide and suicidal behaviour, saying:<br>
  <br><i>“Too many articles release specific and excessive details on those that
    have taken their lives. Our media has a huge responsibility to care for its sources.
    I do not think the dramatic impact targeted for the reader is justified for the
    effects for the families and those themselves.</i><br>
  <br><i>“If you are a journalist, please do look at these guidelines.”</i><br>
  <br>Samaritans have <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/">
    media guidelines</a> for journalists reporting on stories regarding suicide.<br>
  <br>In 2018, the occupation with the highest number of men dying by suicide in
  the UK was construction and building trades, followed by road transport drivers.<br>

  <br>In the same year, the occupation with the highest number of women dying by
  suicide was women working in caring personal services.<br>

</iframe><br>
<br>Liberal Democrat Councillor Paul Tilsley raised the issue of long waiting
times to seek treatment for a mental health issue:<br>
<div id="quote">“If you go along to your GP in the morning, 25% of the people
there have a mental problem, not a physical one. We have to recognise that it is an
issue collectively. We need to equal and prioritise mental health, so nobody takes
their own life.”</div><br>
<br>Cabinet Member for Health and Social Care Paulette Hamilton, who forwarded the
motion, assured members that “it’s not a strategy that is left on the shelf.<br>
<br><i>“A strategy is a book of pages that we need to wait to come to life.
  I can assure you that it will not just be a document left on the shelf, its a
  piece of work that we need to work on together as a system.”</i><br>
